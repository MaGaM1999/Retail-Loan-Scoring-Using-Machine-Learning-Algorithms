This project aims to predict the status of loan applications and score loan applications based on machine learning models. Therefore, loan scoring is a vital task for banks and financial institutions, as it helps them evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers and reduce the risk of loan defaults. Traditionally, loan scoring models rely on statistical methods and manual processes, which are often inefficient and inconsistent. With the advancement of machine learning techniques, there is an opportunity to develop more accurate and reliable loan scoring models that can leverage large and complex data sets. This project reviews the loan scoring using machine learning models and compares the performance of different algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Adaptive Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting using accuracy, F1 score, and AUC. Therefore, XGBoost was the champion model and achieved the highest accuracy (0.9324), F1 score (0.9155), and AUC (0.9285).
